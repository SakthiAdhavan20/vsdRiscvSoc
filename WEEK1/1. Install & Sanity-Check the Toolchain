# 🛠️ RISC-V Toolchain Setup Guide (RV32IMAC)

This guide explains how to unpack the RISC-V toolchain, configure your environment, and verify that everything is working correctly.

---

## 📦 1. Unpack the Toolchain

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
tar -xvzf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz
```

This will extract a directory, typically named `opt` or `riscv-toolchain`, containing the toolchain files.

---

## 📁 2. Locate the bin/ Directory

Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd path/to/extracted/folder/opt/riscv/bin
```

Replace `path/to/extracted/folder` with the actual path where the toolchain was extracted.

Then list the contents:

```bash
ls
```

You should see binaries like:

- `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc`
- `riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump`
- `riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb`

---

## 🌐 3. Add Toolchain to Your PATH

### 🔹 Temporary (for current terminal session):

```bash
export PATH="$PWD:$PATH"
```

### 🔹 Permanent (recommended):

To make the change permanent:

**For Bash users:**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/home/sakthi/Desktop/VSD/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**For Zsh users:**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/home/sakthi/Desktop/VSD/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## ✅ 4. Verify Installation

Run the following commands to ensure the toolchain is working:

```bash
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc --version
riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump --version
riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb --version
```
